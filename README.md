### Laravel Livewire w/ Alpine.js Demeo

To be honest, I really enjoy Livewire/Alpine!  Composing UI while staying within Laravel felt like super convenient. And, coming from a Vue background, the Alpine syntax felt familiar.


Unfortunately, I don't have any more personal time to throw at this so there's a few requirements I'm missing:
1. The top pinned note is highlighted blue, however, every new note added will be highlighted until the page refreshes.  This is due to the fact that data passed to nested components don't aren't reactive like Vue properties. 
2. The deleted notes across the bottom don't overlap like they do in the image send to me.


All in all, I had a lot of fun learning Livewire/Alpine!
